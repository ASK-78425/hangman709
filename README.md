# Hangman
This project will implement the classic game of Hangman in Python. The overall aim is to create a simple, efficient, and user-friendly version of the game.

Under the hood, the project relies on fairly simple functions, an overall game class, and of course some user input to play the game. In terms of installations/imports, we are using Python's built-in 'random' module (_see https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/random.html_) to set the word that must be guessed by the player.
